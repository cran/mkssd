Description: Generates efficient balanced non-aliased multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging the elements of the generator vector. Attempts to generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). Displays the progress of generation of an efficient multi-level k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100% means that one full round of interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs.
